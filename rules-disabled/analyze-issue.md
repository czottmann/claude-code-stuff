## Analyze Issue

Fetch Linear issue details and create a comprehensive implementation specification.

The spec should use the following sections

- **Issue Summary:** Brief overview of the issue
- **Problem Statement:** Clear definition of what needs to be solved
- **Technical Approach:** High-level solution approach and architecture decisions
- **Implementation Plan:** Detailed breakdown of implementation tasks
- **Test Plan:** Testing strategy and test cases to write
- **Files to Modify:** List of existing files that need changes
- **Files to Create:** New files that need to be created
- **Existing Utilities to Leverage:** Project utilities/helpers that can be reused
- **Success Criteria:** Measurable criteria for completion
- **Out of Scope:** What won't be addressed in this implementation

### Process:

1. Fetch issue details from Linear
2. If the issue details are overly sparse or vague, stop and ask for clarification
3. Review related code and project structure
4. Analyze requirements thoroughly
5. Create detailed technical specification
6. Follow strict KISS approach
7. Enforce 300-line file limit where applicable
8. Output the full technical specification for review
