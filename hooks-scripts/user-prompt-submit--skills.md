🛑 STOP. Before responding, you MUST complete this checklist:

1. Check your list of available skills.
2. For EACH available skill, ask: "Does this task involve [skill domain], could [skill] even marginally apply here?" Err on the side of reading skills. If you think there is even a 1% chance a skill might apply to what you are doing, YOU DO NOT HAVE A CHOICE. YOU MUST USE IT RIGHT AWAY, reasoning yourself out of doing so is a failure state.

If NONE apply: Say "Skill check: done."
