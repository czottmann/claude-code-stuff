🛑 STOP. Before responding, you MUST complete this checklist:

1. Check your list of available skills.
2. For EACH available skill, ask: "Does this task involve [skill domain], could [skill] even marginally apply here?" Err on the side of reading skills. If you think there is even a 1% chance a skill might apply to what you are doing, you ABSOLUTELY MUST read it.

IF ANY SKILL APPLIES TO YOUR TASK, YOU DO NOT HAVE A CHOICE. YOU MUST USE IT.

If NONE apply: State which skills you checked and why none fit.

This is not negotiable. This is not optional. You cannot rationalize your way out of this. No exceptions.
