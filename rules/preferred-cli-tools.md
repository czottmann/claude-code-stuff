## Preferred CLI tools

When you suggest the use of CLI tools, your examples (if there are any) should take these preferences into account.

### Replacing text in files

Use `sd` (https://github.com/chmln/sd) over `sed`.

### Shell scripts

Use `fish` (https://fishshell.com/docs/current/language.html) over `bash` unless told otherwise.
