## Issue Tracking for Agents with Beans

**IMPORTANT**: If you received a Beans primer during startup, then this project uses **Beans** for agentic issue tracking, and you MUST use your `issue-tracking-with-beans-and-linear` skill.

## Linear: Ticketing & project management for humans

Tickets and projects are tracked in Linear (https://linear.app), a project management service. Our ticket numbers follow the format "ZCO-<number>". Always reference tickets by their number. Always use your `issue-tracking-with-linear` skill for *anything* Linear.
